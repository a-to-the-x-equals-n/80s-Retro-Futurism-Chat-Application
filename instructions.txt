Server:

The server should ask the user for an IP address (or to press enter for localhost) and should ask the user for a port number (or to press enter for default port). 

The server should also ask the user for their username.

Display the server and client usernames next to their respective messages in the conversation. 

Ensure that both server and client can view the entire conversation.

After establishing the necessary connections, the server waits for an incoming connection and message from a client.

When a message is received from the client, the message is printed to the screen and the server - side user should be prompted to send a message back to the client. 

If an exit keyword, such as “end” is entered on either side of the application, both sides of the application should shutdown.
